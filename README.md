## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the data and code necessary to reproduce the results presented in the paper:

> **"Adaptive Prediction Markets for Non-Continuous Contributions"** by Michael Vitali, Pierre Pinson.
>
> **Conference:** Submitted at PSCC 2026
>
> **Abstract:** Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data ownership and competitive interests.
> In contrast to recent proposals within cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a non-cooperative one, based on prediction markets.
> There, independent agents trade forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of the agents,
> (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling missing submissions.
> Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several desirable economic properties.
> Case-studies using simulated and real-world data allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market design.*
